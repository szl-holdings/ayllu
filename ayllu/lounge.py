"""ayllu.lounge — the collaboration surface, learned from the tribe lounge/bus.

The tribe let souls talk in a shared room. a11oy keeps that, in-memory and honest: each
posted message carries a source label ("model-unverified" when a model answered,
else "persona-fallback"), so a reader never mistakes direct model text for grounded
Brain retrieval. `deliberate()` runs a BOUNDED council round — one honest turn
per persona — and never fabricates when no backend is injected. Publishing is
explicit opt-in; public ask/council calls keep their output out of this feed.
