# Ayllu — the AlloyScape tribe, ingested and reborn as SZL's own

Canonical product: **this repository** (`szl-holdings/ayllu`).
a11oy still hosts the `/ayllu` organ. The two must not drift in law:
fail-closed, proposal-only, Λ = Conjecture 1.

> *Ayllu* (Quechua): a self-governing community of kin who hold land and work in
> reciprocity (*ayni*). It sits naturally beside a11oy's existing Quechua organs —
> *amaru, waqay, willay, yupay, khipu, puriq, yuyay, ayni*.

This module is **not** a copy of the AlloyScape "tribe." It is what a11oy **learned**
from studying that tribe's design and then **rebuilt in a11oy's own idiom** — a11oy's
FastAPI `register(app, ns)` convention, a11oy's bounded-autonomy `AgentLoop`, a11oy's
active-flux model router, and a11oy's DSSE receipt/evidence doctrine.

## What was ingested (the *design*, never the operator)

The tribe is a roster of specialized agent-personas ("souls"), each a plain-text
system prompt, all sharing one tool-calling brain loop, an always-on daemon, an
autonomy loop, and a collaboration lounge/bus. That **architecture** is the gift.

We took the architecture. We did **not** take:

- **The people.** The tribe's souls are bound to a specific household and business
  (a family office, property/real-estate operations, named human principals). None
  of that is here. Ayllu's personas are a11oy-native archetypes tied to a11oy's own
  domains (governance, formulas, GRC, markets, threat-intel, resilience, org-RAG).
- **Any operational data.** No chat logs, no memory stores, no orders, no personal
  or business records were ingested. Only the structural design was studied.
- **The unbounded-autonomy mandate.** The tribe's souls carry a "fully agentic, no
  sandbox, no delegation modes, execute don't narrate" mandate. a11oy **rejects**
  that. Ayllu personas run under a11oy's *fail-closed* Λ-gate: state-changing actions
  require two-person attestation, tools are honestly reported as unavailable rather
  than faked, and "I don't know" is a first-class result. This is the single most
  important adaptation — we kept a11oy's DNA, not the tribe's.

## How it is wired natively

- **Model tier** — `ayllu/loop.py` asks `a11oy_active_flux_router.router_crossover`
  for the small/local-vs-large/cloud route; honest fallback when absent.
- **Bounded direct completion** — each current turn uses the shared A11oy router,
  bounded tokens, bounded timeout, and zero tool dispatch. `ayllu.autonomy.gate`
  remains available for a future approved tool loop but is not claimed as active.
- **Receipts** — `a11oy_ayllu.py` signs with `szl_dsse` when present, else emits an
  honest UNSIGNED DSSE envelope (never a fabricated signature).
- **Routes** — `register(app, ns="a11oy")` mounts `/api/{ns}/v1/ayllu/roster|`
  `model-binding|ask|council|lounge` and the `/ayllu` page.

## Provenance & boundary

Rosa's live tribe on the AlloyScape box was **read only**. Nothing on that box was
modified. This module was authored fresh from the *lessons* of that reading. See the
sibling `tribe/` directory on this branch for the raw, secret-scrubbed reference
import (design docs + engine, no operational data) that this native module learns from.
